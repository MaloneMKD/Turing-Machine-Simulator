# Turing-Machine-Simulator

This project is a Turing machine simulator. It allows the user to design, build and test their turing machine design.
It provides a play-by-play of state changes, creates a summary table of the Turing machine and creates an execution summary after every input test.
I hope people learining theoretical computer science will find this program both useful and fun.
Enjoy...
